/*
 * This file just handles high-level block transfers and logical audio and control functions 
 * control_ethernet does all the Ethernet setup work. They are mutual friend classes.
 * Audio data can be broadcast from a master to a number of slaves using an IP broadcast address, 
 * or simply transferred between two consenting hosts
 * local IP, MAC address are set up in control_ethernet (as they stay the same for each host)
 * port and target IP are unique to each class - port is different for control messages, targets may differ, depending on what's being done.
 *
 * For most applications a master node will handle management tasks (including providing a DHCP service...) 
 * and possibly be the only node allowed to broadcast packets (other than ICMP, etc).
